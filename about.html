                    Front End Developer
                    I found a love for design while pursuing engineering in college. 
                    This may seem like a drastic change but in some ways, they're actually very similar.
                     For example, I learned to problem solve, think deeply about my approach, and realize there are multiple ways to reach an answer. 
                     All of these apply to design so I'm grateful I had a little detour.
                     Because of it, I have a unique perspective when tackling design problems and even life.</p>
